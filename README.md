# Zoom Single Item
A Firefox extension to permanently resize a single element in a website (including all pages in the same domain).

Press Ctrl+Alt and the element under the cursor will be highlighted. Then, scroll up or down to resize it.

This could be useful for accessibility, or simply for when a very repetitive task is cumbersome due to constantly having to click very small items on a website.

The custom size will be stored in your browser's local memory.
